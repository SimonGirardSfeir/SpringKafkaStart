# Spring Boot Kafka Application

This is a **Java Spring Boot application** integrating **Apache Kafka**, **Protobuf Serialization**, and **Confluent Schema Registry** for structured event-driven messaging.

## Overview
- Utilizes **Kafka** for asynchronous, distributed messaging.
- Implements **Protobuf** for efficient and compact data serialization.
- Leverages **Schema Registry** for schema validation and compatibility management.

## Requirements
To run this application, the following infrastructure is needed:
- **Kafka cluster** with multiple brokers.
- **Zookeeper** for cluster coordination.
- **Confluent Schema Registry** for managing Protobuf schemas.

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates **enterprise-grade Kafka integration** with **schema evolution support**, making it suitable for **high-performance, real-world distributed systems**.
